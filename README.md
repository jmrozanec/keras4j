Because we develop models using Keras, but should be able to use them from any JVM language!

We aim to develop a library that would allow to load any Keras model persisted as hdf5 file and use it from any JVM language. 
We are not willing to develop a whole framework to train DNNs: use Keras to train it and Keras4j to use it.
